### üöÄ Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
-   A running [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database instance.
-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for containerized deployment)

#### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [your-backend-repo-url]
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the project root and populate it with your configuration. Use the `.env.example` as a template:

    ```env
    # .env.example
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE"
    JWT_SECRET="YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_KEY_THAT_IS_LONG_AND_RANDOM"
    PORT=5000
    ```

4.  **Apply database migrations:**
    This command will create all the necessary tables in your database based on the Prisma schema.
    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev
    ```

5.  **(Recommended) Seed the database:**
    This script will clear the database and populate it with initial sample data (admin user, workshops, etc.) for testing and development.
    ```bash
    npx prisma db seed
    ```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Available Scripts

-   **Run in development mode (with hot-reloading):**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

-   **Run in production mode:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

-   **Run tests:**
    ```bash
